# Laravel 12 Test Project

This repository is a test project built with Laravel 12. Below are the installation steps to get the development environment set up on your machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you can install Laravel 12, you need to have the following installed:

- **PHP (>= 8.1)**
- **Composer**
- **XAMPP**

### Step 1: Install XAMPP

1. **Download XAMPP**: 
   Go to the [official XAMPP website](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) and download the installer for your operating system.

2. **Install XAMPP**:
   - Open the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
   - During the installation, make sure to install Apache and MySQL.
   - Once installed, launch XAMPP Control Panel.

3. **Start Apache and MySQL**:
   - In the XAMPP Control Panel, start the **Apache** and **MySQL** services.
   - You should now have a local server running at `http://localhost`.

---

### Step 2: Install Composer

1. **Download Composer**:
   - Go to the [official Composer website](https://getcomposer.org/download/) and download the installer for your operating system.

2. **Install Composer**:
   - **Windows**: Run the Composer installer, which will set up Composer globally and automatically add it to your system PATH.
   - **macOS / Linux**:
     - Open your terminal and run the following commands:
       ```bash
       curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
       mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
       ```
     - This installs Composer globally on your machine.

3. **Verify Composer Installation**:
   - Run the following command in your terminal:
     ```bash
     composer --version
     ```
   - This should display the installed version of Composer.

### Step 3: Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/afreena02/myProjectTest.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd myProjectTest
```

---

### Step 4: Install Laravel Dependencies

Run the following command to install the necessary project dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

---

### Step 5: Create the Database

Now, create the database in your MySQL server.

#### Using phpMyAdmin:
1. Go to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin` in your browser.
2. Log in with your MySQL credentials (typically `root` for both the username and password if using XAMPP).
3. Create a new database called `website`.

#### Using MySQL Command Line:
```bash
mysql -u root -p
```
Once logged in to MySQL, create the `website` database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE website;
```

---

### Step 6: Configure the `.env` File

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Now, open the `.env` file and update the database credentials to match your local MySQL setup:

```env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=website
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=root
```

Make sure to adjust the database credentials based on your XAMPP setup.

---

### Step 7: Generate the Application Key

Generate the application key, which is required for encryption and other Laravel functionalities:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

This will update the `APP_KEY` in the `.env` file.

---

### Step 8: Run Migrations

Run the database migrations to create the necessary tables:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

---

### Step 9: Run Seeders (Optional)

If your project has seeders that populate your database with initial data, you can run them using:

```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

---

### Step 10: Serve the Application

To run the Laravel application locally, use the built-in Laravel development server:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

 application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

---

## Environment Configuration (`.env`)

Your `.env` file should be configured as follows:

```env

## Troubleshooting

- **XAMPP Not Starting**: If Apache or MySQL does not start in XAMPP, make sure the required ports (80 for Apache, 3306 for MySQL) are not being used by other applications.
- **Composer Issues**: If you encounter issues while using Composer, try running the following commands:
  - `composer update`
  - `composer install`
  - `composer clear-cache`
